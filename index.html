<h2>CSV format explanation</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    Format is comma-separated with quotes like Excel.  A guide to columns:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Cohort group type: Think of this as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type#C_and_syntactically_similar_languages">enum type</a> name.</li>
    <li>Cohort group value: Think of these as enum values within an enum type.</li>
    <li>Cohort day: Day to which the entry belongs, in the format MM/DD/YY (e.g., 10/25/12 would be October 25th, 2012).</li>
    <li>State1: Number of users exclusively in state 1.</li>
    <li>State2: Number of users exclusively in state 2.</li>
    <li>... Additional state columns</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    First row is used to name the various user states you have. It should be in the format "Cohort group type,Cohort group value,Cohort day,State1 name,State2 name,...".
  </p>
  <p>
    The dataset may have the same user appear in many rows that are of different
    group types. What's important is for each group type the user is only in one
    row with one group value; aka the tuple (group value, cohort day) should be
    a unique row for each cohort group type. Order of the rows does not matter.
  </p>

  <h3>Example CSV</h3>
  <p>
    Here's a simple example for a fake social network with "Sign-up Referrer",
    "Favorite feature", and "Total" cohort group types. This only counts a user
    towards one sign-up referrer row, one favorite feature row, and one
    total row. In the case of "Total" the only valid grouping value is the empty
    string, which this tool treats specially.

    <div class="example-table-container">
      <table class="example-table">
        <tr>
          <th>Cohort group type</th>
          <th>Cohort group value</th>
          <th>Cohort day</th>

          <th>Sent first message</th>

          <td>5</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </p>

  <h3>Negative values</h3>
  <p>
    The sign of a column value is treated specially. The cohort data may include
    two rows with the same (group value, cohort day) tuple, but one with all
    positive column values, and one with all negative column values. Example
    usage: When a user joins your service, have a positive value on their
    birthday. When the same user leaves the service, have the same negative
    value on their leave date. This lets you see the rate of sign-ups and drop-
    offs independently. If you view both positive and negative values
    cumulatively, you will plot your peak active users over time.

<h1>Why cohort analysis?</h1>
<div>
<p>
  A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic or experience
  within a defined period (<a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study">Wikipedia</a>). It's used a
  lot in health to track how different groups of patients respond to disease and
  medication. It can be used in business to track progress in the funnel.
</p>
<p>
  For software and websites, cohorts are useful because they let you measure the
  impact of your product changes over time. Simple example: Using cohorts you
  can see the conversion rate of new users from two months ago and compare it to
  new users of today. Ideally, this would let you judge if your software is
  getting better over time, users are getting happier, etc. Sometimes you'll see
  that things are getting worse.
</p>
<p>
  Cohort analysis can apply to more than just users. For example, you could
  treat a set of articles on a blog as the source dataset; the levels of traffic
  or reshares could be mutually exclusive states; and you could treat common
  tags as a group type, or author as a group type. This tool would let you drill
  down and compare all of those groupings pretty easily.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most interesting things about cohort analysis is the graphs change
  over time. If you take a snapshot of your cohort data today and then take
  another snapshot two months from now, you'll see that the older cohort bars
  have changed. This happens because users who signed up two months ago remain
  active and continue to make progress in your funnel over extended periods.
  It's useful to save your cohort datasets after you collect them, so you can
  compare to the past.
